  <div class="home text-4xl max-w-3xl mx-auto">
    I'm trying to build some Vue.js x TailwindCSS components here. First I draw
    stuff in Figma, and I try to recreate it in tailwind. Any canvases /
    backgrounds you may encouter here are all drawn in Figma.

    <br />
    <div class="pt-10">
      I'm having fun with this, and I hope I can make someone elses' life
      easier.

    <div class="flex items-center space-x-4 pt-4">
      Copy and paste away. But I could really use a greet'n'tweet @opejovic in
      return.
    </div>

    Peace,
