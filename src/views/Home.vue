  <div class="home text-3xl max-w-3xl mx-auto">
    I'm trying to build some
    <span class="font-mono">Vue.js x TailwindCSS</span> components here. First I
    draw stuff in <a class="underline" href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>,
    and I try to recreate it in
    <a class="underline" href="https://www.vuejs.org">Vue</a>
    and
    <a class="underline" href="https://www.tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a>. Any
    canvases / backgrounds you may encouter here are all drawn in Figma.

    <div class="pt-4">
      I get a lot of the inspiration from Tailwind creators, Adam and Steve, and
      sites like Stripe and Github.
    </div>

    <div class="pt-4">
      I'm really having loads of fun with this, and I hope I can make someone
      elses' life easier.
    </div>

    <br />
    <div class="pt-4">
      Copy and paste away. PS. I could really use a greet'n'tweet
      <a class="underline" href="https://twitter.com/opejovic">@opejovic</a>
      in return.
    </div>
    <br />
    Peace,
    <br />
