  <div class="home text-3xl max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-8">
    <p>
      I'm trying to build and share full responsive
      <span class="font-mono">Vue.js x TailwindCSS</span> components here.
    </p>

    <div>
      First I draw stuff in
      <a class="underline" href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, and I try to
      recreate it in
      <a class="underline" href="https://www.vuejs.org">Vue</a>
      and
      <a class="underline" href="https://www.tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a>. Any
      canvases / backgrounds you may see here are drawn in Figma.
    </div>

    <div>
      I get a lot of the inspiration from Tailwind creators, Adam and Steve, and
      sites like Stripe and Github.
    </div>

    <div>
      I'm really having loads of fun with this, and I hope I can make someone
      else's life easier.
    </div>

    <div>
      Copy and paste away. PS. Say hello
      <a class="underline" href="https://twitter.com/opejovic">@opejovic</a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/opejovic/breezy" class="underline">star</a> me
      up.
    </div>
    <p>
      Peace,
    </p>
